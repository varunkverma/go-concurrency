The Sleeping Barber
*   A classic CS problem introduced by Dijkstra in 1965.
*   A barber goes to work in a barbershop with a waiting room with a fixed number of seats.
*   If no one is in the waiting room, the barber goes to sleep.
*   When a client shows up, if there are no seats available, he or she leaves.
*   If there's a seat available, and the barber is Sleeping, the client wakes the barber up and gets a hair cut.
*   If the barber is busy, the client takes a seat and waits his or her turn.
*   Once the shop closes, no more clients are allowed in, but the barber has to stay until everyone is waiting gets a hair cut.
